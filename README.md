### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Oksana Samokhvalova, a Front-End Developer based in Toronto, Canada.
Currently, I'm looking for remote job opportunities to build something great with great people.

- :star: Iâ€™m into all things React <img src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/20/000000/react.png"/> 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m curious about Vue.js and Node.js
- :heavy_division_sign: You can find me hanging on CodeWars and wondering how to improve my math skills
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects (JavaScript, in particular React)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with TypeScript
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything <a href="https://twitter.com/oksanadev">here</a>
